                        the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will

                        application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement
                        terms would not result in a fundamentally fair
                        arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the
                        provisions of these Terms as a court would. All issues
                        are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues
                        relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability
                        of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration
                        proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined
                        than trials and other judicial proceedings, the
                        arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an
                        individual basis that a court can award to an individual
                        under these Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the
                        arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be
                        overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.

                        their ability to travel and other pertinent
                        circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a
                        location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your
                        claim is for $10,000 or less, PearAI agrees that you may
                        choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely
