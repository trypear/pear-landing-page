              intentions as a company, and so here we&apos;ll outline exactly
              what we track. We aren&apos;t here to steal or sell your data, but
              just allow you to make what you want.

              &quot;PearAI,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or
              &quot;our&quot;) handles personal information in relation to our

              information about our privacy practices, but it is not a contract

              If you opt to use PearAI&apos;s hosted services (e.g., PearAI
              Server), the only personal data we store is the information you
              provide during registration, such as your name, email address,
              company name (if applicable), and any other optional details you
              may choose to provide during the registration process. Aside from
              this, we maintain metrics on activity on servers, such as number
              of requests, as this is needed to handle abuse and quotas. We do
              not store the actual contents of your requests.

              Payment information is securely processed by our payment processor

              Your codebase is not directly stored by PearAI. As a technical
              necessity of our prompt logging system, any content within your
              prompts - including any incidental code snippets - is captured as
              part of the prompt text. This logging is solely used for debugging
              and improving the user experience.

              For model interactions, we have a zero-data retention policy for
              Anthropic models and zero-data retention policies are currently
              pending for other models.

              All indexing for your codebase (for PearAI to have codebase
              knowledge) happens locally on your machine, ensuring your complete
              codebase remains private and secure on your system.
