              PearAI&apos;s goal is to reduce the time it takes for an
              individual to go from idea to creation. Coding itself is a crucial

              advancement of AI, it may drastically change over the coming
              years. We aim to build the environment that will encompass these
              changes, both in the short-term and long-term.

                Passionate about empowering individuals, they recognize code and
                media as the most scalable tools a single person can utilize.
                With a combined following of over 500k subscribers and over 30
                million views, they&apos;ve decided to combine media and code,

                They&apos;re building the next open-source AI-powered code
                editor, PearAI, with full transparency through videos,
                livestreams, and direct Discord calls/chats.
