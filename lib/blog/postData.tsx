    I spent the last 2 months working on PearAI, an Open Source AI-Powered Code
    Editor. It's like having an expert on your codebase right next to you. We
    achieve this with Retrieval Augmented Generation. This is my new startup

    We are launching our product next week, and we needed to build out our
    server this last month. As we're building fully in public, here's exactly
    how we did it. Hopefully, this helps you design a server with scalability,
    resilience, and security in mind.

    What's this server for?
  </h2>

  <p class="mb-4 text-base sm:text-lg">
    PearAI offers two different services for LLM:
  </p>

  <ol
    class="ml-4 list-inside list-decimal space-y-4 text-base sm:ml-6 sm:text-lg"

    <li class="pl-2">
      <span class="font-semibold">Use PearAI's hosted server:</span> Pay
      subscription for unlimited usage. Underlying LLM is abstracted for
      convenience and latest AI technology.
    </li>
    <li class="pl-2">
      <span class="font-semibold">Use API key:</span> Users self-manage and pay
      per token to the LLM Provider. On PearAI's side, this is open source and
      fully transparent. Users can also use their own local LLM.

    0. Never Start From Scratch

  <p class="text-base sm:text-lg">
    I'm a big fan of creating my own templates and never starting from scratch
    again. I open source all of these, and you can find the Flask API Template I
    made/used for this project here:

    1. Authentication
  </h2>

  <p class="mb-4 text-base sm:mb-6 sm:text-lg">
    We needed sign-up and sign-in functionality, as well as JWT tokens for each
    user. For this, we used Supabase, which handles authentication of users.
    This is how we are doing this:

      Why Claude 3.5?
    </h2>
    <p class="text-sm sm:text-base">
      Claude 3.5 offers significant improvements in natural language
      understanding and code comprehension. By leveraging this model, we aimed
      to:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-4 text-sm sm:pl-6 sm:text-base">
      <li>Enhance the accuracy of code suggestions and completions</li>

      The Implementation Challenge
    </h2>
    <p class="text-sm sm:text-base">
      One of the main hurdles we faced was adapting our existing infrastructure
      to work with Claude 3.5. Unlike other LLMs we've used, such as OpenAI's
      models, Claude 3.5 required a different approach to prompt handling:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-4 text-sm sm:pl-6 sm:text-base">
      <li>Our existing setup handled server prompts from the client-side</li>
      <li>
        Claude 3.5 needed server-side prompt handling for optimal performance
        and security
      </li>
      <li>
        This discrepancy required us to rethink our architecture for Anthropic
        integration specifically
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="space-y-4">
    <h2
      class="text-xl font-bold text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-400 sm:text-2xl"
    >
      Our Solution
    </h2>
    <p class="text-sm sm:text-base">
      To address this challenge, we implemented a hybrid approach:
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal space-y-2 pl-4 text-sm sm:pl-6 sm:text-base">
      <li>
        We maintained our client-side handling for existing LLMs to ensure
        backwards compatibility
      </li>
      <li>
        For Claude 3.5, we developed a new server-side handler specifically for
        Anthropic API calls
      </li>
      <li>
        We created a routing mechanism to direct requests to the appropriate
        handler based on the selected AI model
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm sm:text-base">
      This solution allowed us to leverage Claude 3.5's capabilities while
      maintaining support for our other AI models.

    </h2>
    <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-4 text-sm sm:pl-6 sm:text-base">
      <li>
        Rate limits provided by OpenAI for these o1 models are currently lower
        compared to other options. For most tasks, it's still recommended to use
        Claude or GPT4o instead of o1 models due to these limitations.
      </li>
      <li>
        When choosing between o1 models, prefer o1-mini over o1-preview. It will
        use fewer of your credits while providing similar performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Due to current rate limits, only annual subscribers of PearAI can use o1

        Some Key Differentiators For The Future Of AI Code Editors
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the world of AI-powered code editors, the playing field for AI models is surprisingly level. Most editors simply use the best available models on the market, which are all improving everyday. This means that the real distinguishing factors lie elsewhere:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>User Interface and User Experience Extensibility
          <p class="text-gray-600 text-base mb-4">Open source allows for community-driven UI/UX improvements; with an extremely tight user feedback loop, we know exactly what you want. Code editors are uniquely suited for open source development because the developers themselves are users of the product! <br/><br/> This almost means that for our PearAI Inventory, where we integrate the best AI tools on the market within PearAI, other contributors can suggest AI tools to integrate on their own.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Trust and Transparency
          <p class="text-gray-600 text-base mb-4">With open source, the codebase is visible to all, fostering trust through transparency and allowing for independent security audits.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Community Support
          <p class="text-base text-gray-600 mt-1 mb-4">Open source projects benefit from a global community of developers, leading to faster bug fixes, feature requests, and overall product improvement. For example, during our launch, we had no Linux version, but many people who only use Linux wanted to use PearAI. Someone from our community (s/o to Max!) single-handedly developed a Linux distribution, which is now available today for everyone to use.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Distribution
          <p class="text-base text-gray-600 mt-1 mb-4">Due to the underlying models being similar between products, the team with the coolest and strongest community will be the most popular.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These factors align perfectly with the principles of open source software, making it an ideal approach for AI code editors.

        Why Us: PearAI's Thriving Open Source Community
      </h2>
      <p>
        PearAI stands out with one of the most active open source community among AI code editors. Unlike many open source projects that rely on just one or two contributors, PearAI boasts an impressive statistic after only 4 month of development (as of the date of this blog):
      </p>
      <figure class="mt-4">
        <figcaption class="text-center text-sm mt-2">Around 40% of contributions of the PearAI project are made by the communtiy.</figcaption>

        Beyond Code: Open Source Founders
      </h2>
      <p>
        At PearAI, our commitment to openness extends beyond our codebase. As founders, we embrace an "open source" approach to our journey:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>We share our entire development process online</li>
        <li>Our YouTube channel documents our progress and insights</li>

          As you may know, PearAI is an Open Source AI Code Editor and fully transparent to the public. We are driven by our open source community that is working under the shared goal of making the best AI code editor in the world. However, sometimes we have bigger tasks that need more expertise and time from a contributor. This requires a lot of effort, so we want to provide more incentive and rewards for these contributors.

          Introducing PearAI's Open Source Bounties!
        </h2>
        <p>
          For some larger tasks, we will add a monetary bounty, defined in the issue description. Simply put, if you complete the issue (i.e. your code gets merged), you will get money as a reward. Due to the fast pace we need for PearAI, multiple people may work on the same task at the same time independently. However, if only one gets merged, a certain other amount of worthy attempts should be compensated as well for the efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a worthy attempt (and we will be generous with this), you will be rewarded as well by the attempt bounty, which is also pre-set in the issue description.

          How to Participate
        </h2>
        <p>
          Simply look for tickets tagged with "Bounty" <a href="https://github.com/trypear/pearai-app/labels/Bounty" class="text-primary-600 hover:underline">here</a>. These larger tasks often require context for PearAI and expertise, so they will likely be application-based to start. The link to apply (takes less than a minute) will also be in the issue description.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope that this adds even more whimsy to bringing the best AI code editor into existence together.

        We have made a mistake, and for this we apologize to Continue and the Open Source community. We genuinely want to learn from our mistakes and grow.
        To fix this, we made big changes, and we had them reviewed by friends in the open source space, along with a law team to ensure we did everything the right way this time.
        These are the changes PearAI made in attempts to correct our mistakes.
