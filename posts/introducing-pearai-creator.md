# Introducing PearAI Creator (Beta)!

You can now turn your ideas into creation within PearAI V2! PearAI focuses on starting you out the right way, with templates made with strong foundations and best practices.

We're starting with webapps, and here's how it works!

## How It Works

### 1. Share Your Vision

Type in your idea that you want to build. This can be anything, such as:

- An admin dashboard for your busy life
- A new business idea you have
- A fun game for you and your friends!

### 2. Start with Expert Templates

First, PearAI Creator will use PearAI Templates to start you off. Most other 0 to 1 tools merely make frontend toys, but PearAI starts you off with templates that experts use for production level apps! PearAI ensures that your projects are built to grow and scale.

### 3. Create a Beautiful Frontend

PearAI Creator will design and implement a beautiful, responsive frontend for your application, following modern design principles and best practices.

### 4. Implement Backend Functionality

After this, PearAI Creator will complete the backend functionality of your app. This uses:

- PearAI Database for data storage
- PearAI Authentication for user management
- Production-ready security practices

_Note: As these features are still in beta, you may need to set up some configuration. Check out our [database setup guide](/blog/how-to-setup-pearai-database) for more details._

### 5. Connect Frontend and Backend

PearAI Creator seamlessly integrates your frontend and backend, ensuring smooth data flow and optimal performance.

### 6. Deploy Your App

Finally, PearAI Creator uses PearAI Deploy, powered by Netlify, to launch your app so you can share it with anyone!
